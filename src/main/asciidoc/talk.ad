[NOTE.speaker]
====
Drainage pump for New Orleans!

600.000 Liter PRO SEKUNDE!

=== Reactive Streams

4 Interfaces

7 Methods

1 TCK

=== Implementations

RxJava 2

Reactor

[NOTE.speaker]

And others

Don't try to implement it yourself.

== Why isn't async sufficient

=== Blocking!

[NOTE.speaker]
====
CompleteFuture offers methods intended for regular use that return either a value immediately or wait until a value becomes available.
This requires blocking.
====

=== Turtles all the way down

```
Future<Future<Future<Future< ... >>>>
```

== Relational Databases

=== What happened so far?

=== Before 2016

Proprietary solutions for single databases.

=== 2016

Oracle announces ADBA at Java One.

=== 2017

Oracle announces ADBA at Java One.

Discussion on the mailing list.

=== General disappointment.

No interest in supporting reactive streams.

[NOTE.speaker]
====
Argument: Reactive Streams is only usable with third party library (true)
API must not depend on such a thing.
====

=== 2018

Let's do something!

Pivotal announces R2DBC at Spring One.

With a real driver: PostgreSQL

=== Today

3 Drivers

PostgreSQL

MS SQL Server

H2

There is a community effort of MySQL

Active support by the community

== Architecture of R2DBC

=== r2dbc-spi

Drivers implement this.

=== Drivers

`r2dbc-postgres`

`r2dbc-h2`

`r2dbc-mssql`

=== r2dbc-client

A simple client for end users.

=== spring-data-r2dbc

Better client.

a reactive repository abstraction.

=== r2dbc-proxy

Driver proxy.

== Demo

== What else?

=== Connection Pool.

Work in progress.

=== Transactions.

We are working on it

=== Block Hound.

https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound

=== We want you!
